# nomzProject

As the first group project during my tenure at The University of Texas at Austin's Coding Bootcamp, Nomz was created so that a user can go online, and find nutritional data for any product they search for. A user can sign in using a Google Authentication Method, and save that data to their account. Also, when they search for a particular item, the Google Maps API was used to return the grocery stores closest to their location.
During this project, we learned the value of utilizing resources that include well constructed documentation, and the value of creating a Minimum Viable Product within an incredibly short window, which was accomplished. We also learned the power of collaboration, and the power of communication while collaborating as well.
